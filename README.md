# The-Simon-Game
A fun version of the game 'Simon' loosely played on 'Simon Says'. This game is a fun way to test your memory. This game was part of the course "The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp - Dr Angela Yu" on Udemy. I have added my own feature to repeat the game pattern to the user at the beginning of each level. Built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
